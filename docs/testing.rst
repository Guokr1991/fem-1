Testing
=======

There are test scripts / models available for code validation and future
development (`test/README.md <test/README.md>`__). Please use existing
tests if fixing bug / editing existing features, or create new tests for
new features. Ipython notebooks documenting testing, performance, etc.
are also saved in some of the testing directories.
