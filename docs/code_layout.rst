Code Layout
===========

This repository contains 3 subdirectories of code:

1. ``mesh``: scripts to generate meshes, apply boundary conditions and
   simple loads (`mesh/README.md <mesh/README.md>`__)
2. ``field``: `Field II <http://field-ii.dk>`__ scripts to simulate
   acoustic radiation force excitations to impose as point loads on your
   model. The ``probes`` submodule can be utilized with these scripts
   (`field/README.md <field/README.md>`__)
3. ``post``: scripts to post-process LS-DYNA output for processing /
   visualization in ls-prepost, Matlab, and Paraview
   (`post/README.md <post/README.md>`__)

Please see the ``README.md`` files in each respective subdirectory for
more detailed descriptions of the available scripts.
