All scripts can be run as\+: {\ttfamily python script.\+py \mbox{[}-\/-\/options\mbox{]}}. The {\ttfamily -\/-\/help} option can be used to get descriptions of all available options and default values.

\subsection*{Active Scripts }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries \hyperlink{GenMesh_8py}{Gen\+Mesh.\+py}\+:} Generate a uniform, 3\+D hexahedral mesh with specified spatial extent and element density.
\item {\bfseries \hyperlink{bc_8py}{bc.\+py}\+:} Specify boundary conditions on the mesh, including those for quarter-\/ and half-\/symmetry (using L\+S-\/\+D\+Y\+N\+A coordinate system).
\item {\bfseries \hyperlink{CreateStructure_8py}{Create\+Structure.\+py}\+:} Create structure within an existing mesh of specified shape, location, size and Part I\+D.
\item {\bfseries \hyperlink{GaussExc_8py}{Gauss\+Exc.\+py}\+:} Create a Gaussian-\/weighted A\+R\+F excitation with specified Gaussian width, location and amplitude cutoff.
\item {\bfseries \hyperlink{TopLoad_8py}{Top\+Load.\+py}\+:} Create a loading condition on the top suface of the model, either prescribed displacement, force, or acceleration.
\item {\bfseries fem\+\_\+mesh.\+py\+:} This will never be directly run, but it is a module with common functions used by several of the scripts.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Legacy Scripts }

The following scripts are maintained for old simulations that are still being used for older projects.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries \hyperlink{parseElemsNodes_8py}{parse\+Elems\+Nodes.\+py}\+:} Legacy script to extract {\ttfamily nodes.\+dyn} and {\ttfamily elems.\+dyn} input files from a mesh generated in ls-\/prepost using {\ttfamily Mesh\+Gen.\+cfile}.
\item {\bfseries Mesh\+Gen.\+cfile}\+: Example command script to generate a mesh, similar to {\ttfamily \hyperlink{GenMesh_8py}{Gen\+Mesh.\+py}}, but with some quirks (e.\+g., points at 0 sometimes are not printed). This generates a {\ttfamily mesh.\+dyn} file that is space delimited and can be parsed using {\ttfamily \hyperlink{parseElemsNodes_8py}{parse\+Elems\+Nodes.\+py}}.
