All Python code is 3.x only and should adhere to PEP8 standards.

Unit tests must pass for all modifications / additions.
-unit tests should be checking for logic/algorithmic validity, ability to read syntax based on dyna-specific versions, etc.
Note: unit tests check method correctness and differ from patch tests, which are more for FEM-validity 
(patch tests use small meshes of different geometries to verify expected behavior of setup before running a large-mesh FEM sim)
